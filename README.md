Machine learning: Building a model from example inputs to make data-driven predictions vs. following strictly static program instructions.

Machine learning logic:

Instead of id, case, while, until, uses the data parsed to a format we can use, then we pass this formatted data to an algorithm that analyses the data (data analysis) and then it creates a model that implements the solution to solve the problem based on the data.


## Ways machines learn from data:

* Supervised
    Data is labeled and has features, and we know the result we want to obtain for that data.

* Unsupervised
    Search clusters of blank data and encounters groups of data that share the same traits.


|**Supervised**|**Unsupervised**|
|---|---|
|Value prediction|Identify clusters of like data|
|Needs training data containing value being predicted|Data does not contain cluster membership|
|Trained model predicts value in new data|Model probides access to data by cluster|


## Machine Learning Workflow

An **orchestrated and repeatable** pattern which systematically **transform and processes information** to **create prediction solutions**.

1. Ask the right question
2. Preparing data
3. Selecting the algorithm
4. Training the model
5. Testing the model --> if tomething went wrong, iterate from (2)

### Machine Learning Workflow Guidelines
- **Early steps are most important**. Each step depends on previous steps
- **Expect to go backwards**. Later knowledge effects previous steps
- **Data is never as you need it**. Data will have to be altered.
- **More data is better**. More data => better results.
- **Don't pursue a bad solution**. Reevaluate, fix or quit.
